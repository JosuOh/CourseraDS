# Contains Applied Data Science Capstone Labs </br> by Joshua Oh

## Introduction

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. Through this Applied Data Science Capstone, we have learned several
methods of obtaining data from the SpaceX API, formatting the data, and visualizing it in multiple different ways.
